# Advent of Code 2020 

https://adventofcode.com

Decided to go old-school this year and do it in C++ - given my current role is very C++ facing and I'm needing to use the old skills, it's good practice to hone fluency.

Always easier in Python to knock out the algorithms, but choosing the easy option is no fun :)

As the problems get harder, maybe I'll need to delve into Boost and also lean of a bit of unit testing, up to day 4 it's been fine though....
